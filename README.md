Etch-A-Sketch
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to draw on a grid by hovering over squares, with features to adjust grid size, clear the drawing, and enable a rainbow mode for colorful sketches.

Features
Dynamic Grid Size: Choose from predefined grid sizes (16×16, 32×32, 64×64, 128×128) to customize your drawing canvas.
Drawing Functionality: Hover over grid squares to color them, simulating the Etch-A-Sketch drawing experience.
Clear Grid: Reset the grid to start a new drawing.
Rainbow Mode: Enable a mode where hovering over squares colors them with random RGB values for a vibrant effect.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structures the web page and elements.
CSS: Styles the grid, buttons, and overall layout.
JavaScript: Implements interactive features like drawing, grid resizing, and mode toggling.
How to Use
Select Grid Size: Click on one of the grid size buttons (e.g., 16×16) to set the canvas size.
Draw: Hover over the grid squares to color them.
Clear Drawing: Click the "Clear Grid" button to reset the canvas.
Rainbow Mode: Click the "RAINBOW" button to enable random colors on hover.
